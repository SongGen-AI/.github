## What We Build

Cremi.AI is a music-first AI platform that transforms any audio track into production-quality music videos.

```
Audio Input → Music Analysis → Storyboard Generation → Scene Rendering → Post-Production → Output
```

**Under the hood:**
- **Music Analysis Engine** — genre, mood, energy, tempo, instrumentation, and lyrics extraction
- **Storyboard Generator** — scene-by-scene visual narratives tuned to song structure
- **Multi-Model Rendering** — Sora, VEO, Kling, Runway, Midjourney & more
- **Beat-Sync Pipeline** — frame-accurate visual sync to rhythm and energy
- **VFX & Motion Layer** — transitions, color grading, character consistency, raccord sync
- **Lip-Sync Engine** *(coming soon)* — character-level lip sync to vocals

## Why Cremi Exists

Every day, thousands of tracks hit streaming platforms and die in silence — not because the music is bad, but because artists can't afford the **$5,000+ visual tax** of a music video. We're building the **#1 AI tool for music video production** to end that.

## Tech Philosophy

- **Music-centric, not prompt-centric** — the song drives the output, not a text box
- **Multi-model architecture** — no vendor lock-in, best model for each task
- **Cinematic by default** — film-quality output without manual tuning

> *"We didn't build a tool; we built an engine to end the visual tax. No great song should ever stay invisible."*
