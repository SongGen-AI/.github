# AI Software Engineer — Cremi.AI

**"Every day, thousands of artists upload masterpieces only for them to die in silence. We're building the engine to end that."**

## About Cremi.AI

Cremi.AI is an AI-powered platform that transforms any song into a stunning music video — in minutes, not months. We combine the hottest generative AI models (Sora, Veo, Kling, Runway, and more) with deep music analysis to deliver cinematic-quality videos that sync to every beat, vibe, and lyric.

We're a small, ambitious team on a mission to **make songs visible** — serving thousands of indie artists, creators, and music channels worldwide, with the majority of our users in the US. We've hit $10K MRR and we're just getting started. What you see today is 5% of the vision.

**This is not a big-corp job. This is a rocketship seat.**

## The Role

We're looking for an **AI Software Engineer** who lives at the intersection of software craftsmanship and AI-native development. You'll be building core product features end-to-end — from backend pipelines that orchestrate multiple AI models to the frontend experiences that make complex technology feel effortless for creators.

You'll ship fast, break things intelligently, and use AI tools (especially Claude Code) as a force multiplier — not a crutch.

### What You'll Do

- Build and scale our full-stack platform: **Python** backend, **Next.js** frontend
- Design and maintain event-driven architectures using **Kafka** for real-time video generation pipelines
- Develop AI orchestration workflows with **LangGraph** and **Claude SDK** to power music analysis, storyboard generation, and prompt engineering at scale
- Integrate and optimize across multiple generative AI providers (image and video models)
- Own features from idea → architecture → implementation → production
- Automate relentlessly — if you're doing the same thing twice, build a system to do it for you
- Collaborate directly with the founding team to shape product direction and technical strategy

### What We're Looking For

**Must-haves:**

- **5+ years** of professional software development experience
- Strong full-stack skills: **Python** (backend/APIs), **Next.js/React** (frontend)
- Experience with **Kafka** or similar event streaming platforms
- Familiarity with **LangGraph**, **Claude SDK**, or comparable LLM orchestration frameworks
- **Vibe coding is a must-have skill** — you use AI coding tools daily and push them to the limit. Claude Code proficiency is strongly preferred. You don't just use AI; you advocate for it and build workflows around it
- A-player mindset: high ownership, high output, low ego. You do whatever it takes to ship
- Comfortable working in a fast-moving startup where priorities shift and ambiguity is the norm
- Strong English communication skills (our users and documentation are global)

**Strong pluses:**

- Hands-on experience with **image/video generation models** (Stable Diffusion, Runway, Kling, Sora, Veo, etc.)
- Understanding of video processing pipelines, FFmpeg, or media encoding
- Experience scaling distributed systems — **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **ELK stack**, load balancing, autoscaling, observability
- Experience building internal tools and automations for marketing teams in a startup environment
- Background in music technology, audio analysis, or creative tools
- You love music. You edit videos for fun. You get why this matters

## How We Work

- **Remote-first** — work from anywhere. Hybrid in Ho Chi Minh City is optional if you prefer in-person energy
- **Small team, big ambition** — you'll have direct impact on a product used by creators globally
- **AI-native culture** — we don't just build AI products, we use AI to build. Automation and AI-assisted development are in our DNA
- **Ship fast, learn faster** — we're in rapid growth mode serving a global audience

## Compensation

- **Competitive salary** (negotiable, up to $1,500/month in the first year)
- **Stock options** — meaningful equity to compensate for early-stage salary. You're joining early; the upside is real
- The chance to build the **#1 AI tool for music video creation** from nearly the ground floor

## Why Join Now?

You won't find another role where you get to combine cutting-edge AI, music, visual storytelling, and startup speed — all at once. We're at the stage where one engineer can change the trajectory of the entire product. If you want your work to matter, this is it.

**Music knows no borders. Neither should creativity.**
