## What We Build

Cremi.AI is a music-first AI platform that transforms any audio track into production-quality music videos. The pipeline handles the full stack of video generation:

```
Audio Input → Music Analysis → Storyboard Generation → Scene Rendering → Post-Production → Output
```

**Under the hood:**
- **Music Analysis Engine** — Extracts genre, mood, energy, tempo, instrumentation, and lyrics from raw audio
- **Storyboard Generator** — Auto-generates scene-by-scene visual narratives tuned to song structure
- **Multi-Model Rendering** — Integrates with Sora, VEO, Kling, Runway, Midjourney & more for image/video generation
- **Beat-Sync Pipeline** — Frame-accurate visual synchronization to rhythm, vibe, and energy transitions
- **VFX & Motion Layer** — Scene transitions, color grading, character consistency, and raccord sync
- **Lip-Sync Engine** *(coming soon)* — Character-level lip synchronization to vocal tracks

## Why Cremi Exists

Every day, thousands of tracks are uploaded to streaming platforms and die in silence — not because the music is bad, but because artists can't afford the **$5,000+ visual tax** of a music video. Cremi eliminates that barrier entirely.

We're building the **#1 AI tool for music video production**, starting with indie artists and scaling to enterprise.

## Who It's For

| Segment | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **Indie Artists** | Turn new songs & covers into videos on a budget |
| **Content Creators** | Scale to 30-50 videos/month with consistent quality |
| **Professional Artists & Agencies** | Generate variations (dance ver, lyrics ver, karaoke ver), find visual inspiration |
| **Enterprise** | Mass-produce music video content at speed |
| **Fan Communities** | Create tribute videos for favorite artists |

## Core Capabilities (Now)

1. **Deep Audio Analysis** — bitrate, sample rate, duration, genre, mood, energy, theme, lyrics, instrumentation
2. **Visual Style Suggestion** — color palette, lighting, cinematography direction
3. **AI Storyboard Writing** — music-specific scene breakdowns with optimized generation prompts
4. **Image & Video Generation** — multi-model rendering with motion and VFX
5. **Scene Transitions** — seamless, beat-matched visual flow
6. **Beat/Vibe Sync** — visual-audio alignment at the rhythm level

## Roadmap

- [x] Music analysis engine
- [x] AI storyboard generation
- [x] Multi-model video rendering (Sora, VEO, Kling, Runway, Midjourney)
- [x] Beat-sync pipeline
- [x] Vibe editing & character sync
- [ ] Lip-sync engine
- [ ] Dancing motion synthesis
- [ ] Director Mode — full creative control over every frame
- [ ] Trend analysis & visual direction advisor

## Tech Philosophy

- **Music-centric, not prompt-centric** — the song drives the output, not a text box
- **Multi-model architecture** — no vendor lock-in, best model for each task
- **Credits never expire** — pay for what you use, use it when you want
- **Cinematic by default** — film-quality output without manual tuning

## Brand
